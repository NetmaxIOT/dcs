## Description

OpenDCS is a set of services and applications for creating custom data
acquisition and control systems in a distributed manner. The target operating
system is Linux and its modern distribution variants.

### Release 0.1

The current public release is a beta release that is a fork of
[dactl](https://github.com/coanda/dactl) and probably won't be in a usable
state until at least the next minor release. The libraries include GIR output
for use in other languages, the support of which is still a work in progress.

### Installation Instructions:

Instructions for installing OpenDCS and it's dependencies can be read
[here](https://dactl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/setup.html).
